## Instructions
This homework is a bit less traditional this week. There are some errors in the code below. In addition add notes and titles to the code chunks that explains what the code chunk does. Use AI tools, notes from class, or any other resources to help fix the errors. Feel free to edit any plots to your preference. Don't forget to answer the two questions at the bottom. Upon completion, you should not have to '#' out any of the code chunks.

Push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.   

Again make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!

9. What are two drawbacks and two benefits of AI?

Drawbacks:
- not always accurate
- you have to be specific with your input

Benefits:
- can propose different solutions
- learns from your code and can helps you improve

10. Do you think you will use AI for coding in the future? Why or why not?

Yes, I think I will use AI for coding in the future. Even now, I use AI to help me with my coding. It helps me catch errors and suggests different solutions. It also helps me when I forget how to use a certain function or when I need help with formatting. Using AI with coding will be more common in the future, and I think it will make coding faster, easier, and simpler.
